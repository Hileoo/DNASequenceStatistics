# DNASequenceStatistics
DNA sequencing identification of patterns of nucleotides 

Based on the rules:  
![Rules](https://github.com/Hileoo/DNASequenceStatistics/blob/master/rules.jpeg)  

if you have been given the following sequence of nucleotide letters: CCAAATT  
We should be able to generate the following counts of each pattern: { AA: 2, AT: 1, CC: 1, CA: 1, TT: 1 }  
Note that, a pattern MTAC should match with ATAC or CTAC, as M can resolve to A or C.
